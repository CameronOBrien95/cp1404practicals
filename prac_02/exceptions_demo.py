CP1404/CP5632 - Practical
Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?
"""

try:
    numerator = int(input("Enter the numerator: "))
    denominator = int(input("Enter the denominator: "))
    while denominator <= 0:
        print("Cannot divide by zero!")
        denominator = int(input("Enter the denominator: "))
    fraction = numerator / denominator
    print(fraction)
except ValueError:
    print("Numerator and denominator must be valid numbers!")
# except ZeroDivisionError:
#     print("Cannot divide by zero!")
print("Finished.")

# 1. a ValueError occurs when the input is not an Integer
# 2. ZeroDivisionError occurs when the denominator is a 0, it wont occur when the numerator is 0
# 3. I can change the code to include an error checking while loop, that checks
# to see if the denominator is equal to or less than 0
